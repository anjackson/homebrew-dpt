Homebrew-dpt
============
This repository contains formulae for [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) that I'm using as Digital Preservation Tools.

Installing Homebrew-dpt Formulae
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap anjackson/dpt` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one in mxcl/master, you can `brew install anjackson/dpt/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/anjackson/homebrew-dpt/master/<directory>/<formula>.rb
```
